# mvc

The project was intended to help a friend of mine with his course project. The idea was to build a web-app using MVC approach. As long as my friend had issues with all parts of the project (MVC idea itself, PHP, creating a web-site layout and setting up an apache web-server), I helped him to create a layout with simple form verification. After that the template was cut into pieces to be able to dynamically build a web-page with PHP script.
In my project *.php was used only to test ajax-request and server set up, it's not an actual php part of the project.
